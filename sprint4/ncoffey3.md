# What you Planned to do
* Test the functionality of the current scrapers on the backend and ensure compatability with the Masterscript
* Make sure that all new finished scrapers get incorporated into the Masterscript.
* Help my teammates work on databasing their scrapers
* Work on any debugging any issues within the database to ensure a solidly populated database for the demo.

# What you did not do
* N/A

# What problems you encountered
* I have been using MySQL Workbench for some time now but it can still be challenging because of the steep learning curve and depth of features present. However I've figured everything out that I needed to.

# Files you worked on
README.md
backend\scrapers\fragrancex.py
backend\scrapers\fragrance_buy.py
backend\scrapers\MasterScript.py

# What you accomplished 
* I helped incorporate all of our scrapers into our Masterscript. Part of this was ensuring that the scrapers had a standardized format for arguments. The first being the max number of fragrances that the scraper will scrape. The user can specify this when running the command otherwise a default will be used. The second being a argument on whether the scrapers will be run in headless mode. Meaning whether the user will see the browsers being run or not. I also helped my teammates figure out the standardized format for returning a json that will then be used by the Masterscript.
